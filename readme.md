Ethereal Blog is a very simple blogging software made with Bootstrap and PHP. The original purpose of this was to serve in me advancing my PHP skills. Before this I had only made simple PHP registration websites and messed around with forms a little. I decided to put all those skills to test in one little project and post it on GitHub.

I desgined the website with Figma. You can view the design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/0mmnabuHTi1zcAAykfN9yi/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1). This isn't the first thing I have designed but I feel like the design came out pretty well.
