# Ethereal Blog

Ethereal Blog is a very simple blogging software made with Bootstrap and PHP. The original purpose of this was to serve in me advancing my PHP skills. Before this I had only made simple PHP registration websites and messed around with forms a little. I decided to put all those skills to test in one little project and post it on GitHub.

I desgined the website with Figma. You can view the design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/0mmnabuHTi1zcAAykfN9yi/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1). This isn't the first thing I have designed but I feel like the design came out pretty well.

You can attempt to take the code and set it up on your own server if you go through the code and setup the database structure but seeing as this is just for me to learn I wont be doing that. I probably am only making this for future use on my personal website.

## Remaining

There isn't much remaining with this template. It was a learning situation and I learnt a lot. Here are some of the things I may add;
 - I need to add pagination (I keep forgetting to do so)
 - Create user account if it doesn't exist.

## Features

- Beautiful blog website made with Bootstrap.
- Easily clean and editable HTML & CSS.
- Login system for admins.
- WYSIWYG for blog creation.
- Easily managable blogs.
- Responsive on all devices.
